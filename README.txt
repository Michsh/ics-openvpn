This is my first Android project, so some things may be done in a completely stupid way.

See  the file todo.txt for ideas/not yet implemented features (and the bug tracker).

Build instraction:

- Install sdk
- Install ndk

Do ndk-build in the root directory of the project.

Use eclipse with android plugins to build the project.

Optional: Copy minivpn from lib/ to assets (if you want your own compiled version)
