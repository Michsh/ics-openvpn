- Implement tabbed filebrowser with 
   1. tab file selection
   2. tab inline file for safer storage
   
 - implement security notice fragment
   - explain plain text storage of all data except for android keystore
   - explain even more insecure of storage on sd card
  
- implement a small app that can do cert+key+ca => p12 or suggest an app on the market
   - Implementation in ICS OpenVpn would require SD_WRITE permission which I would like to avoid
   
- finish .ovpn -> configuration importer
    - depends on inline file storage, since config files can include inline files
    - 

Missing configuration options:

IPv6 support:
- Enable IPv6 (tun-ipv6)
- Implementing/testing IPv6 route/ifconfig/DNS Server
