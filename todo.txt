Ideas:
  
- implement a small app that can do cert+key+ca => p12 or suggest an app on the market
   - Implementation in ICS OpenVpn would require SD_WRITE permission which I would like to avoid
   - Do cert+key+ca => p12 inside the app, import directly to keystore
   
- implement an encryption for profiles, so no sensitive data has be stored in plain text
   - encrypt/decrypt with android private storage key (+no user input required)
   
- general settings dialog
   - encryption of profiles
 
- Give the notification a nice speed bar
   
- map SIGUSR1 to SIGINT

Bugfixes:
 - startpath file explorer

Missing configuration options:

IPv6 support:
- fix bogus tun-ipv6 warning

Tap support:
- Actually it is possible to emulate tap with tun device, a minimal implementation would have to do:
   - generate random mac
   - strip macs header on receive
   - append mac header on send
   - implement arp, possible the most difficult task ...
      - need to chose right mac of receiver
